  <div class="message to">5 things you wish KMIT had</div>
  <div class="message from">I wish we always had Open Gate System. :P, Fests- so that we don’t just have fun there but get to learn new things as well, a refreshing excursion trip for the final year students may be after placements for us to make great joyful memories.</div>
  <div class="message to">Favourite Adda on the campus</div>
  <div class="message from">Um, Badminton court, as it’s never too hot there</div>
  <div class="message to">Advice to 1st, 2nd, 3rd Year students</div>
  <div class="message from">Attending JNTU classes isn’t that worth..just enjoy your engineering years but yeah try giving your best in the Technical subjects(programming)! Make immense memories and have loads of fun, you won’t get these years back again..so make the most out of it..! Good luck to all of u! :):)</div>
  <div class="message to">Things everyone should do in KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">Live. Laugh. Learn.</div>
  <div class="message to">Any fascinating person/people you’ve met at KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">Yeah. One can find all kinds of people in KMIT.</div>
  <div class="message to">What will you miss about college life or being at KMIT?</div>
  <div class="message from">Friends, Fun during class hours, Lab sessions(we hardly had any serious labs, for us lab was just another class where in we could click nice pictures secretly :P) and most importantly the freedom to do anything and everything. Life after College isn’t that easy at all.</div>
  <div class="message to">Best experience at KMIT:</div>
  <div class="message from">2014 ie, our 3rd year Dandiya night. One of the best events of our time.</div>
  <div class="message to">Where do you see KMIT 5 years from now?</div>
  <div class="message from">A purely CSE based Autonomous college with great placements having top companies visiting the campus.</div>
  <div class="message to">5 things that only happen in KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">Lol, many things can only happen in KMIT  like…things start with high hopes but never reach it’s main goal…everything has an abrupt ending..basically they don’t end they just stop all of a sudden. Freedom of Speech – students are given the opportunity to put their problems in front of the high authorities without any fear or hesitation. Construction- you will find some part of the college under construction most of the time or all of the time. Marks- they say you focus on FS and placements..JNTU will be managed by lecturers, It’s hardly that our marks are managed.</div>
  <div class="message to"> What is the crowd like in KMIT?</div>
  <div class="message from">As I already said one will find all kinds of people here.</div>
  <div class="message to">If you could switch places with a teacher, who would it be?</div>
  <div class="message from">Sirisha Ma’am..she is one of the sweetest faculty member in KMIT.</div>
  <div class="message to">Describe KMIT in one word/one sentence</div>
  <div class="message from">A place that makes u dream…dream like realllyy big.</div>
  <div class="message to">What did you do for the last time in KMIT?/What is your best last memory?</div>
  <div class="message from">Can’t think of one. </div>
  <div class="message to">Favorite year in college</div>
  <div class="message from">2nd and 3rd year. The best years of KMIT.</div>
  <div class="message to">A funny moment in the class</div>
  <div class="message from">1st year Drawing classes were really fun. Nothing can beat that. </div>
  <div class="message to">When have you been punished and for what?</div>
  <div class="message from">I was never punished individually…always with the whole class for not doing assignments or not listening to classes.</div>
  <div class="message to">Tell us an incident where you got away with doing something naughty</div>
  <div class="message from">Our section CSE-B is very famous for the kind of unity which we have..we never wrote any assignment tests or slip tests. We always somehow managed to postpone the tests to a date that never came ending up writing no tests at all. All this was so much fun! </div>
  <div class="message to">Funny story that you can look back on and laugh</div>
  <div class="message from">Many things with my crazy friends.</div>
