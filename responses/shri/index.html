  <div class="message to">Advice to 1st, 2nd, 3rd Year students</div>
  <div class="message from">Advice to 1st years: Get out of the first year building without a backlog in M-1. You are not a school kid anymore. Take charge of your life. Explore. Enjoy responsibly. Participate in events.<br>

  2nd Year students: If didn’t clear M-1 from first year, clear it asap. Enjoy college life before finishing school gets to you. Organize and also participate in college events and co-curricular activities. You won’t find time later on.<br>

  3rd Year students: Make peace with finishing school, that’s KMIT’s biggest gift to you. Be aware that you are a senior and juniors are always going to be more than you in KMIT.<br>

  3rd years: Now is when you have the luxury of being confused about career, not in fourth year. Plan ahead because it helps you stay cool. Prioritize interests and sacrifice few for the sake of rest of them.
