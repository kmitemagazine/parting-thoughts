  <div class="message to">5 things you wish KMIT had</div>
  <div class="message from">A swimming pool. A go cart track. A theater. A private pond with some deers and rabbits and if possible even a real friendly tiger. Last but not the least a helipad.<br>
  Just imagine how cool it would be to have all these in our college but then I know that our college can never afford all this so nonetheless… I believe that our college should have some amazing demonstration labs where you can practicality see the working of what you are studying and what uses it has in the future. There is a lack of practical learning in our system….. So yeah.. If u ask me The true knowledge and experience comes from failing an every attempt to succeed. And when you do things practical you really know how bad you are .. Rather than just studying from the books and then dumping them in exams.</div>
  <div class="message to">Favourite Adda on the campus</div>
  <div class="message from">Okay no particular favourite adda but then …. Me and my friend spent a lot of time in the washrooms to avoid classes and lecturers. We once spent a whole class inside a washroom….( in the first year I guess ) Btw it’s pretty cool inside especially in summers and sometimes stinky too.. But yeah upper floor washrooms are pretty clean!!! Haha</div>
  <div class="message to">Advice to 1st, 2nd, 3rd Year students</div>
  <div class="message from">Now that’s a question where I should be answering responsibly I guess.. But you know what.. Let me tell you this… May be the most important thing is “Learn to FAIL “. Because engineering is the last safest thing that will happen to you guys.. If you fail now… You’ll have the support of your parents. May be your friends too. And trust me, you really don’t have to answer anyone…it’s your life Live it… live it right now..!!! Learn to study in a better way if you fail once. Never give up on getting up and fighting for what you deserve.. Sometimes its really hard for you to get back but this is just engineering phase of yours.. Trust me its a safe house… You will have hope as long as you believe in it . So never stop believing and never stop dreaming and never stop failing because once you’re out of this life… It’s really going to be hard for you to get back if you FAIL… Success is nothing but a lesson learnt from all your failures. So as long as you strive on learning new things everyday..You will definitely succeed one day</div>
  <div class="message to">Things everyone should do in KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">I guess I’ve summed this in my answer to the previous question right..!!</div>
  <div class="message to">Any fascinating person/people you’ve met at KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">A lot of people.I changed a lot after these people came into my life and I changed even more after they were gone out of my life.. Anyways at the end of the story M a better person now and for me that’s the most imp thing about meeting people… You learn to respond to people reaction or behavior in a better way.. And this is one of the most important quality if u want to become a leader.</div>
  <div class="message to">What will you miss about college life or being at KMIT?</div>
  <div class="message from">I don’t know if I’ll really miss anything.For me my life is a wonderful adventure where I'm always in search of new and fascinating and challenging things. And in that adventure college is a part of it and i have lots of memories associated with it..but i really don’t think i will miss anything…. Hmm i wish i doo…ha ha But then naaah….!!!! I’ll be too busy working to get into the position where my college will invite me as a guest (at least that’s what I’m planning on right now)</div>
  <div class="message to">Best experience at KMIT:</div>
  <div class="message from">Best experience !!!!! I mean.. May be joining KMIT.. I mean learning in KMIT itself was an experience you know…!!!</div>
  <div class="message to">Where do you see KMIT 5 years from now?</div>
  <div class="message from">Where do I see kmit in 5 years. I guess I’ll feel happy if it gets into some top position and even if it doesn’t that’s just fine with me…!!</div>
  <div class="message to">5 things that only happen in KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">Our college is no exception to any other engineering college. So there is no such thing as 5 particular things about kmit. But then, if I have to stress really hard… then… yeah.. We parked our bikes in the FOOTBALL ground (in first year). The ground used to be full of bikes and cars back then! That’s it.</div>
  <div class="message to"> What is the crowd like in KMIT?</div>
  <div class="message from">Crowd… Okay..you just have all kinds of people… The crowd in Kmit is like the crowd in any decent engineering college would have.. That’s it..</div>
  <div class="message to">If you could switch places with a teacher, who would it be?</div>
  <div class="message from">Not anyone in particular..!!!</div>
  <div class="message to">Describe KMIT in one word/one sentence</div>
  <div class="message from">KMIT = “An ENGINEERING college” I guess that says it all..!!</div>
  <div class="message to">What did you do for the last time in KMIT?/What is your best last memory?</div>
  <div class="message from">The last memory, the moment when we were talking together and all of a sudden when we realized that things were about to change (ending of our college life right..) Had all kinda mixed emotions…!!</div>
  <div class="message to">Favorite year in college</div>
  <div class="message from">Every year had its own set of surprises!!!</div>
  <div class="message to">A funny moment in the class</div>
  <div class="message from">Okay now this was the craziest thing . Me and my friend burst out laughing so badly in front of 3.1 external ma'am, because one of my friends(a boy) randomly happened to get a Barbie pencil box and he opened it when the external asked for a pen.</div>
  <!-- <div class="message to">When have you been punished and for what?</div>
  <div class="message from"></div> -->
  <div class="message to">Tell us an incident where you got away with doing something naughty</div>
  <div class="message from">I’m a real decent boy you know.. I really don’t have anything great to share when it comes to doing something naughty</div>
  <div class="message to">Funny story that you can lok back on and laugh</div>
  <div class="message from">We were sitting at the Mtech block and studying something. So there was this Mtech sir who had come and randomly asked “What is engineering?”, and all of a sudden a very smart friend of mine..stood up with confidence and said ” Sir engineering is nothing but higher education” If you wished, I could actually show you his level of confidence and the reaction of Sir when he heard the answer.. We burst out laughing so badly..!!</div>
