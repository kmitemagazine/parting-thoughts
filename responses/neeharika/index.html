 <div class="message to">Things everyone should do in KMIT</div>
Experiment! Make each day count,because every loss you face,every conflict you've overcame,all the
lessons you've learnt, be it about, friendship,compassion,tolerance,selfishness and love. They have made you a better person today. So when you look back,all that you have now are memories.So make as many memories as you can. One day (probably when you are old) these memories make the best
stories.
